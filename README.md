## Learning Resources

### Computer Programming

Computer programming is the capstone of Industry 4.0, Smart Manufacturing and modern Systems Engineering.

If you have an interest in working with and implementing advanced manufacturing and modern, connected systems, then you will need excellent computer programming skills.

#### Python

**Overview**

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great general programming language that is very popular across a wide-variety of
domains. In some measurements, it is _the_ most popular programming language. Python is an excellent choice to start
with if you have never programmed before with its clear and clean syntax, emphasis on code readability and vast amount
reusable libraries.

Python likely has one of the richest open-source ecosystem of libraries for physical engineering and manufacturing work
at the moment.

**Typical Industrial Use Cases**

* Numerical computing and computational geometry (e.g. PCB layouts, path planning)
* Robotics design analysis and programming
* Discrete simulation (e.g. process simulation)
* Data Science
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Vision
* Server-side web applications

**Resources**

None, yet.

#### TypeScript

**Overview**

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language that is developed and maintained primarily by
Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript (a core technology of the World Wide Web) and adds optional static
typing. Given its enhanced feature set and design, TypeScript is arguably a better choice for large web applications
over Vanilla JavaScript and large applications are not uncommon in engineering and manufacturing.

TypeScript has design traits that make it similar to C# (another language developed and maintained by Microsoft) as both
TypeScript and C# share the same language designer - [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg).

The popularity of TypeScript is
[rising rapidly](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-most-popular-programming-languages-rise-of-typescript/) and it
may very well, one day, become as popular as JavaScript itself.

**Typical Industrial Use Cases**

* Edge computing for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications (typically via [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/))
* Industrial graphics via [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) and [WebXR](https://blog.mozvr.com/tag/webxr/)
* Data visualization (for example, using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/))
* Soft real-time, server-side web applications (via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
